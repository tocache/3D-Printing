This is a log and adquired experience in using a Prusa Mini 3D FDM printer:

<b>14/10/2019:</b> Ordered my Prusa Mini with filament sensor and both bed sheets (smooth and rugged)<br>
<b>21/02/2020:</b> Arrived my Prusa Mini! Took only an hour to assemble it<br>
<b>22/02/2020:</b> First 3D prints, all went okay but had some issues in loading/unloadind filament. Printed some cable relief for the ones that goes to the hotend.<br>
<b>01/03/2020:</b> Disassembled the hotend because of a clog, after an exhaustive visual checking I found lots of debris in the heatbreak exactly where the PTFE sits. After assemblying no further under-extrusion or other related filament jamming issues in the hotend or the extruder.<br>
