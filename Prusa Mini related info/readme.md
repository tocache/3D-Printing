This is a log and adquired experience in using a Prusa Mini 3D FDM printer:

14/10/2019: Ordered my Prusa Mini with filament sensor and both bed sheets (smooth and rugged)<br>
21/02/2020: Arrived my Prusa Mini!<br>
01/03/2020: Disassembled the hotend because of a clog, after an exhaustive visual checking I found lots of debris in the heatbreak exactly where the PTFE sits. After assemblying no further under-extrusion or other related filamente jamming issues in the hotend or the extruder.<br>
